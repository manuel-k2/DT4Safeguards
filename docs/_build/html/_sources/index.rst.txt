Introduction
------------
InfraRAPS (Infrastructure Resilience And Preparedness Simulator) is a python framework modeling coupled infrastructure networks and their resilience to extreme events.
It simulates the US energy and natural gas grid as an optimized coupled network combined with a diffusion-based perturbation network to see how the network performance evolves under critical conditions.
In the current version the perturbation models a military attack with nuclear weapons.

Results
-------
The results were visualized with Dash and can be found online under:

https://manuelk.pythonanywhere.com/

Local display: If you want to display the Dash app locally, make sure you have all required packages installed:

`pip install -r final-project/dash/requirements.txt`

Run the Dash app:

`python3 final-project/app.py`

Results are then visible with a browser via http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
